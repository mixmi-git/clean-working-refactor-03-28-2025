# Cleanup Log

This document tracks all cleanup tasks performed on the codebase, including what was removed, the rationale, and verification steps taken to ensure the application continues to function correctly.

## Completed Tasks

### Task 1: Remove Unused `/minimal` Route
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-1-remove-minimal-route`
- **Files Removed:**
  - `app/minimal/page.tsx`
  - `app/components/MinimalProfile.tsx`
- **Verification:**
  - Confirmed `MinimalProfile` component wasn't imported by the working `/integrated` route
  - Verified application still functions correctly after removal
  - Tested that the app loads and the main features work

### Task 2: Remove Unused `/simple` Route
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-2-remove-simple-route`
- **Files Removed:**
  - `app/simple/page.tsx`
  - `app/components/SimpleProfile.tsx`
- **Verification:**
  - Confirmed `SimpleProfile` component wasn't imported by the working `/integrated` route
  - Verified application still functions correctly after removal
  - Tested that the app loads and the main features work

### Task 3: Remove Unused `/debug` Route
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-3-remove-debug-route`
- **Files Removed:**
  - `app/debug/page.tsx`
- **Notes:**
  - The route referenced a non-existent component `EmergencyDebug`
  - Confirmed route wasn't linked from the working `/integrated` route
- **Verification:**
  - Verified application still functions correctly after removal
  - Tested that the app loads and the main features work

### Task 4: Remove Test Route Pages
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-4-remove-test-routes-safely`
- **Files Removed:**
  - `app/auth-test/page.tsx`
  - `app/test-auth/page.tsx`
  - `app/test-navbar/page.tsx`
  - `app/test/page.tsx`
- **Learning:**
  - Initial attempt to remove entire directories failed and broke the app
  - Found that `useAuthState` hook from the hooks directory was used by working components
  - Applied more surgical approach by removing only page files while preserving shared hooks
- **Verification:**
  - Verified application still functions correctly after removal
  - Tested that the app loads and the main features work

### Task 5: Remove `/wallet` Route
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-5-remove-wallet-route`
- **Files Removed:**
  - `app/wallet/page.tsx`
  - `app/components/SimpleWalletConnector.tsx`
- **Verification:**
  - Confirmed `SimpleWalletConnector` component wasn't imported by the working `/integrated` route
  - Verified application still functions correctly after removal
  - Tested that the app loads and the main features work

## Notes for Future Tasks

- **Preserving the Reset Functionality:**
  - Currently accessible via `/reset` route
  - The route is linked from the loading state in `IntegratedProfile.tsx`
  - Consider integrating this functionality into the main UI in the future
  - Code is in `app/reset/page.tsx`

## General Approach Followed

1. Create a specific branch for each cleanup task
2. Verify dependencies before removal using grep searches and import analysis
3. Remove unused files
4. Test the application to verify it still functions correctly 
5. Commit changes with detailed descriptions
6. Push to the cleanup repository

## Lessons Learned

1. **Be Surgical in Cleanup:** When removing code, sometimes a more targeted approach is needed rather than removing entire directories
2. **Check for Shared Dependencies:** Components and routes can share hooks, utilities, and other dependencies
3. **Test After Each Change:** Even small changes can have unexpected impacts
4. **Keep Good Backups:** Having branches for each task made it easy to revert when issues were encountered
