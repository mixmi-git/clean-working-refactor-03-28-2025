# Current Project State

## Achievements
1. Successfully implemented profile data storage with account-specific isolation
2. Implemented profile image upload and storage functionality
3. Created a working account switching mechanism
4. Set up proper profile data persistence using localStorage with account-specific keys
5. Implemented section visibility controls
6. Added proper error handling and loading states

## Current Issues
1. **CSS Loading Error**
   - Error: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'entryCSSFiles')`
   - This appears to be a Next.js build cache issue
   - Affects the application's styling and layout

2. **Placeholder Image 404**
   - Error: `GET /placeholder-profile.jpg 404 in 347ms`
   - The application is looking for a placeholder image that doesn't exist
   - We have `placeholder.png` in the public directory but the code is looking for `placeholder-profile.jpg`

3. **Profile Data Persistence**
   - Profile text data (name, title, bio) is not saving for any account
   - Profile image is being shared across accounts
   - Section visibility changes are not persisting

## Technical Implementation Details

### Profile Data Storage
- Using localStorage with account-specific keys
- Storage keys are generated using the pattern: `mixmi_profile_data_${profileId}`
- Account-profile mapping is stored in `mixmi_account_profile_map`

### Account Switching
- Implemented through the `useAuthState` hook
- Profile data is loaded based on the current account's wallet address
- Each account has its own profile ID and storage namespace

### Current Architecture
- Next.js 14.2.16 with App Router
- Client-side state management using React hooks
- Local storage for data persistence
- Account-specific data isolation

## Next Steps
1. Fix the CSS loading issue by cleaning Next.js cache and updating configuration
2. Update placeholder image references to use the correct path
3. Investigate profile data persistence issues
4. Consider implementing a more robust state management solution if needed

## Known Limitations
1. All data is stored client-side in localStorage
2. No server-side persistence
3. Limited by browser storage constraints
4. No data synchronization across devices
