# Refactoring Documentation

## Project Overview

This document tracks the refactoring progress for the MiXMi Profile Editor application. The goal is to break down the monolithic `UserProfile.tsx` component into smaller, more manageable pieces and implement proper separation of concerns.

## Completed Refactorings

### Authentication Logic

- Created `useAuthState.tsx` hook to centralize authentication state management
- Separated the Navbar into `NavbarContainer.tsx` and `Navbar.tsx` components
- Fixed authentication state detection and visibility of UI elements based on auth state
- Added timeout mechanisms to prevent UI from getting stuck in loading states

### Type Compatibility

- Fixed type compatibility issues between different versions of interfaces
- Ensured consistent type usage across components
- Created type aliases to maintain backward compatibility
- Added type assertions to handle edge cases

### Media Section Extraction

- Integrated the existing `useMediaState.tsx` hook in `UserProfile.tsx`
- Removed direct media state management from the main component
- Ensured MediaSection component receives properly typed props
- Maintained all functionality while simplifying the main component

## Planned Refactorings

### Profile View Component

- Extract the view-only mode into a separate component
- Separate display logic from editing functionality
- Maintain consistent styling between view and edit modes

### Edit Form Modularization

- Start with extracting the basic information section (name, title, bio)
- Create reusable form components for each section
- Implement proper validation and error handling

### Spotlight/Projects Section Extraction

- Create a dedicated hook for managing spotlight/projects state
- Move related handlers to the hook
- Simplify the UI component to focus on rendering

### Shop Section Extraction

- Create a dedicated hook for managing shop items state
- Move related handlers to the hook
- Simplify the UI component to focus on rendering

## Benefits Achieved

- Improved code maintainability and readability
- Better separation of concerns
- Reduced component complexity
- Enhanced type safety
- More focused components with clearer responsibilities
- Better testability for isolated pieces
