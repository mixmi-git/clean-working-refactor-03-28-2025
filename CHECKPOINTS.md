## Checkpoints

### Checkpoint 1: Enhanced Debug Logging - [Current Date]
**Changes Made:**
- Added comprehensive debug logging chain across components:
  - 📦 UserProfileContainer: Initial data loading
  - 🎵 useProfileForm: Form state management
  - 🎨 ProfileEditor: Component rendering and media items state
  - 🎵 MediaSection: Section-specific logic

**Files Modified:**
- app/components/profile/editor/ProfileEditor.tsx
  - Added detailed media items state tracking
  - Added component stack traces
  - Moved debug effects after useProfileForm initialization

**Test Results:**
- [ ] Edit mode tests
- [ ] View mode tests
- [ ] Dark mode consistency
- [ ] Save functionality

**Rollback Instructions:**
1. Revert changes in ProfileEditor.tsx to remove new debug effects
2. Keep original debug logging

**Notes:**
- Debug logging chain now follows data flow from container to section
- Each component uses distinct emoji for easier log tracking
- Added component stack traces to help identify mounting issues
