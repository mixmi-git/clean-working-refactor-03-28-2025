# Refactoring Roadmap

This document outlines the key refactoring tasks identified during our cleanup process. For each task, we provide detailed information about the components involved, the current issues, and recommended approaches.

## 1. Type System Standardization

**Priority:** High  
**Difficulty:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 3-5 days

### Current Issues

1. The codebase uses multiple sources of truth for types:
   - Centralized types in `app/types/` directory (`ProfileData`, `MediaItem`, etc.)
   - Type re-exports in `UserProfileContainer.tsx` (`SpotlightItemType`, `MediaItemType`, etc.)
   - Local type definitions in component files
   - Type incompatibilities between similar types

2. Type paths are inconsistent:
   - Some imports use absolute paths (`@/types`)
   - Others use relative paths (`../UserProfileContainer`)
   - Some component files re-export types

3. Types may have subtle differences that cause incompatibilities:
   - Some types have optional fields that others make required
   - Some use unions while others use specific types

### Components Involved

- `app/types/index.ts` - Central type definitions
- `app/types/content.ts` - Content-specific types
- `app/types/media.ts` - Media-specific types
- `app/components/profile/UserProfileContainer.tsx` - Contains type re-exports
- `app/components/profile/editor/types/EditorTypes.ts` - Editor-specific types
- `app/components/IntegratedProfile.tsx` - Uses centralized types
- Various component files with local type definitions

### Recommended Approach

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Map all type dependencies using static analysis tools
   - Create a visualization of type relationships
   - Document all differences between similar types

2. **Consolidation Phase**
   - Create canonical versions of all types in the `app/types/` directory
   - Ensure all optional/required fields are consistent
   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to describe each type

3. **Migration Phase**
   - Create a migration plan with small, incremental steps
   - Update imports one file at a time, with testing after each change
   - Remove type re-exports from component files
   - Update `tsconfig.json` to enforce consistent import patterns

4. **Validation Phase**
   - Ensure TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors
   - Add type tests to verify type compatibility
   - Document any remaining edge cases

## 2. Checkpoint Files Assessment

**Priority:** Medium  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

### Current Issues

1. Files with "checkpoint" in their names are actually used in production:
   - `app/lib/checkpoints/example-content.checkpoint.ts` - Causes app failure when removed
   - Other checkpoint files may have similar hidden dependencies

2. The usage patterns are not visible through static analysis:
   - No direct imports found via grep searches
   - Likely using dynamic imports or indirect references

3. The naming suggests temporary or developmental status, which is misleading

### Files Involved

- `app/lib/checkpoints/example-content.checkpoint.ts` - Known to be critical
- Other files with checkpoint or backup in their names:
  - `app/components/profile/ProfileView.checkpoint_media.tsx`
  - `app/components/profile/ProfileEditor.checkpoint_sociallinks.tsx`
  - `app/components/profile/UserProfileContainer.checkpoint_media.tsx`
  - `app/components/profile/editor/sections/MediaSection.checkpoint_media.tsx`
  - `app/components/profile/editor/sections/StickerSection.checkpoint_media.tsx`

### Recommended Approach

1. **Discovery Phase**
   - Use browser developer tools to monitor network requests and script execution
   - Add instrumentation to detect dynamic imports
   - Add console logging to checkpoint files to detect when they're loaded

2. **Analysis Phase**
   - Create a dependency graph showing what uses these files
   - Document the actual purpose of each checkpoint file
   - Determine if they're truly needed or can be consolidated

3. **Renaming Phase**
   - For truly production files, rename to remove "checkpoint" suffix
   - Update any dynamic imports or references
   - Consider moving content to more appropriate locations

4. **Testing Phase**
   - Extensive testing after each change
   - Verify that the application works in all states (loading, editing, etc.)

## 3. Modernize and Consolidate Component Architecture

**Priority:** Medium  
**Difficulty:** High  
**Estimated Time:** 5-7 days

### Current Issues

1. Parallel component hierarchies:
   - `IntegratedProfile` and `UserProfileContainer` have overlapping functionality
   - Multiple profile-related components with duplicated logic

2. Inconsistent state management:
   - Some components use React hooks directly
   - Others use custom hooks like `useAuthState` and `useProfileForm`
   - localStorage access is scattered throughout components

3. Complex component relationships:
   - Deep component nesting
   - Props drilling through multiple levels

### Components Involved

- `app/components/IntegratedProfile.tsx` - Main working component
- `app/components/profile/UserProfileContainer.tsx` - Alternative implementation
- `app/components/profile/ProfileView.tsx` - View component with edit capabilities
- `app/components/profile/ProfileEditor.tsx` - Editor component
- Various section components for different profile parts

### Recommended Approach

1. **Architecture Planning**
   - Design a more cohesive component hierarchy
   - Consider implementing a proper state management solution (Context API, Redux, Zustand)
   - Create clear boundaries between view, edit, and data management concerns

2. **Consolidation Phase**
   - Create new, cleaner implementations of core components
   - Extract common logic into shared hooks and utilities
   - Centralize localStorage access into a data service layer

3. **Migration Phase**
   - Gradually replace old components with new implementations
   - Maintain backward compatibility during transition
   - Test extensively after each step

4. **Cleanup Phase**
   - Remove obsolete components once new architecture is stable
   - Document the new architecture for future developers
   - Create component diagrams showing relationships

## 4. Improve Reset Functionality

**Priority:** Low  
**Difficulty:** Low  
**Estimated Time:** 1-2 days

### Current Issues

1. Reset functionality is isolated in a separate route (`/reset`)
2. Only accessible via a link in the loading state
3. Not integrated into the main UI for better user accessibility

### Components Involved

- `app/reset/page.tsx` - Current reset page implementation
- `app/components/IntegratedProfile.tsx` - Contains link to reset page

### Recommended Approach

1. **Feature Enhancement**
   - Extract the reset logic into a reusable utility function
   - Create a modal component for the reset confirmation
   - Add reset option to a settings menu in the main UI

2. **Integration**
   - Add the reset option to appropriate locations (header, profile menu, etc.)
   - Implement confirmation dialog with clear warnings
   - Add more granular reset options (reset profile only, reset media only, etc.)

3. **Testing**
   - Verify reset functionality works correctly in all contexts
   - Test different reset options
   - Ensure good error handling

## 5. Dynamic Import and Code Splitting Optimization

**Priority:** Low  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Estimated Time:** 2-3 days

### Current Issues

1. The application likely uses dynamic imports that aren't obvious
2. Some large components could benefit from code splitting
3. Hidden dependencies make the codebase harder to understand

### Components Involved

- Entire application, with focus on:
  - `app/components/IntegratedProfile.tsx` - Main component with potential for optimization
  - `app/components/profile/ProfileView.tsx` - Large view component
  - Any component that may use dynamic imports

### Recommended Approach

1. **Analysis Phase**
   - Analyze bundle size to identify large components
   - Use tools like `import-cost` to highlight expensive imports
   - Document all dynamic import usage

2. **Optimization Phase**
   - Implement proper code splitting using Next.js features
   - Convert implicit dynamic imports to explicit ones
   - Add loading states for dynamically loaded components

3. **Documentation Phase**
   - Document all dynamic import patterns
   - Create loading state guidelines
   - Update comments to clarify import behaviors

## Implementation Strategy

To successfully implement these refactoring tasks, we recommend:

1. **Incremental Approach**
   - Work on one task at a time
   - Break each task into smaller subtasks
   - Complete a subtask, test, commit, then move to the next

2. **Comprehensive Testing**
   - Maintain high test coverage
   - Test after each significant change
   - Consider adding end-to-end tests for critical workflows

3. **Documentation First**
   - Document the current state before changing it
   - Update documentation as you go
   - Ensure code comments reflect architectural decisions

4. **Branch Strategy**
   - Create feature branches for each major task
   - Use short-lived branches for subtasks
   - Regular merges back to the main branch

By following this roadmap, the codebase will become more maintainable, with clearer architecture, better types, and more explicit dependencies - all while preserving the existing functionality.
