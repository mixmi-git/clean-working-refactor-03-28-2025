# Refactoring Approach

## Lessons Learned from Initial Attempts

### The Importance of Incremental Changes

Our initial attempt to extract the storage logic into a more sophisticated `useStorage` hook led to infinite loading issues. This highlights a critical approach to refactoring in this codebase:

1. **Make Minimal, Incremental Changes**: Even simple refactorings can have unexpected consequences due to complex interdependencies.

2. **Preserve Original Behavior Closely**: The closer our refactored code matches the original code's behavior, the less likely we are to introduce subtle bugs.

3. **Type Safety Challenges**: TypeScript types in this codebase have interdependencies that require careful handling, especially for the `MediaItem` type which has multiple definitions.

### Revised Approach for Safe Refactoring

1. **Minimal Surface Changes**: Our revised `useStorage` hook maintains the same function names and signatures as the original helper functions, simplifying the transition.

2. **Cautious Type Handling**: We use type assertions in specific places where TypeScript cannot reconcile type differences automatically.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: After each change, we ensure the application still loads correctly and functions as expected.

## Future Refactoring Strategy

Based on these lessons, our approach to future refactorings will be:

### 1. Analyze Before Changing

- Thoroughly understand the types and their relationships
- Map data flow between components
- Identify potential circular dependencies

### 2. Implement Changes in Stages

- Break large refactorings into smaller, testable changes
- Make one change at a time and verify it works before proceeding
- Keep new abstractions as close to the original code as possible

### 3. Testing and Verification

- Verify the application loads after each change
- Test key functionality to ensure it still works as expected
- Document any unexpected behavior or challenges

## Specific Strategies for Common Refactorings

### Type Standardization

- Prefer type assertions over changing type definitions
- When standardizing types, check all usage sites carefully
- Be particularly careful with imports from different files that represent the same type

### Component Extraction

- Extract components that don't maintain state first
- When extracting stateful components, use props and callbacks initially instead of context
- Move to context providers only after components are successfully extracted

### Hook Extraction

- Keep hook signatures close to the original functions they replace
- Use simple wrappers initially before adding more sophisticated features
- Test extensively with the components that use the hook

By following these cautious, incremental approaches, we can improve the codebase's architecture while minimizing the risk of introducing new bugs.
