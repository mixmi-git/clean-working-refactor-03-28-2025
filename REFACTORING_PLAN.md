# Detailed Refactoring Plan for UserProfile Component

## Current State
- The `UserProfile.tsx` component is 1522 lines long
- Several hooks have been extracted: `useAuthState`, `useMediaState`, `useProfileState`
- Some sections have been moved to their own components: `MediaSection`, `SpotlightSection`, `ShopSection`
- Recent fixes addressed duplicate variable declarations and type compatibility issues

## Refactoring Phases

### Phase 1: Core Structure Split (Immediate)

1. **Create a ProfileEditor component**
   - Extract the editing functionality from UserProfile
   - Move form-related state and handlers
   - Keep UserProfile as a container that renders either ProfileEditor or ProfileView

2. **Create a ProfileView component**
   - Extract the view-only mode into a separate component
   - Focus on display logic without edit functionality
   - Share styling and structure with editor for consistency

3. **Setup proper routing between view/edit modes**
   - Use query parameters or URL segments to determine mode
   - Implement navigation between modes with proper authentication checks

### Phase 2: State Management Enhancements (Short-term)

1. **Create useSpotlightState hook**
   - Extract spotlight/projects state and handlers
   - Define proper interfaces for project items
   - Implement CRUD operations for projects

2. **Create useShopState hook**
   - Extract shop items state and handlers
   - Define proper interfaces for shop items
   - Implement CRUD operations for shop items

3. **Enhance useProfileState**
   - Add any missing profile fields
   - Implement proper validation logic
   - Add save/load functionality

### Phase 3: UI Component Extraction (Medium-term)

1. **Create form section components**
   - BasicInfoForm (name, title, bio)
   - SocialLinksForm
   - ImageUploadForm with cropper
   - SectionVisibilityForm

2. **Create section components**
   - ProjectsEditor component
   - ShopItemEditor component
   - MediaItemEditor component

3. **Create shared UI components**
   - DraggableList for reordering items
   - ConfirmationDialog for delete operations
   - FormSection wrapper with consistent styling

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization (Long-term)

1. **Implement proper React.memo usage**
   - Memoize expensive components
   - Ensure proper dependency arrays for callbacks

2. **Optimize state updates**
   - Use reducers for complex state logic
   - Implement batch updates where appropriate

3. **Add proper loading states**
   - Skeleton components for loading phases
   - Suspense boundaries for async operations

## Implementation Strategy

1. Start by creating the ProfileView component as it's simpler (read-only)
2. Create the ProfileEditor component skeleton
3. Move form sections one by one to separate components
4. Extract hooks for remaining state management
5. Refine the connections between components
6. Add proper prop typing and validation
7. Implement comprehensive error handling
8. Add unit tests for each extracted component

## Benefits

- Reduced component complexity
- Better separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability and readability
- Enhanced performance through optimized rendering
- Easier testing of isolated components
- Better developer experience with smaller, focused files
