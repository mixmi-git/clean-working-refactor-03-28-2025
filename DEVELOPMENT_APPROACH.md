# Development Approach

## Core Principles

### 1. Incremental Development
- Make small, focused changes
- Test each change thoroughly before moving on
- Keep the application functional at all times
- Document changes as we go

### 2. Backup Strategy
- Create GitHub backups after successful testing only
- Use semantic versioning in repository names (e.g., profile-working-copy2.5)
- Maintain multiple backup points for safety
- Test changes locally before pushing to backup

### 3. Testing Protocol
- Test each component in isolation
- Verify integration with existing components
- Check for regressions in related functionality
- Test in both development and production modes
- Verify mobile responsiveness

### 4. Refactoring Guidelines
- Extract components only when their purpose is clear
- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Keep component responsibilities focused
- Preserve existing functionality while improving code structure
- Document component interfaces thoroughly

### 5. State Management
- Use appropriate hooks for different types of state
- Keep state as close to where it's needed as possible
- Document state flow between components
- Consider performance implications of state updates

### 6. Current Focus Areas
- Breaking down the large ProfileEditor.tsx component
- Improving wallet authentication security
- Maintaining separation between different accounts in the same wallet
- Optimizing performance and user experience

### 7. Quality Standards
- Maintain TypeScript type safety
- Follow consistent code formatting
- Write clear comments and documentation
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Keep bundle size optimized

## Implementation Notes

### Current Approach
- Starting with foundation (validation, hooks, UI components)
- Moving to section-specific editors
- Maintaining working application throughout
- Regular testing and validation
- Frequent, tested backups

### Risk Mitigation
- Keep backup points before major changes
- Document complex logic and dependencies
- Test edge cases thoroughly
- Consider user experience throughout
- Monitor performance impacts

### Success Metrics
- Reduced component complexity
- Improved code maintainability
- Enhanced user experience
- Stable, reliable functionality
- Better development workflow
