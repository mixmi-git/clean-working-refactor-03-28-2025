# Refactoring Documentation

## Project Overview

This document tracks the refactoring progress for the MiXMi Profile Editor application. The goal is to break down the monolithic `UserProfile.tsx` component into smaller, more manageable pieces and implement proper separation of concerns.

## Completed Refactorings

### Authentication Logic

- Created `useAuthState.tsx` hook to centralize authentication state management
- Separated the Navbar into `NavbarContainer.tsx` and `Navbar.tsx` components
- Fixed authentication state detection and visibility of UI elements based on auth state
- Added timeout mechanisms to prevent UI from getting stuck in loading states

### Type Compatibility

- Fixed type compatibility issues between different versions of interfaces
- Ensured consistent type usage across components
- Created type aliases to maintain backward compatibility
- Added type assertions to handle edge cases

### Media Section Extraction

- Integrated the existing `useMediaState.tsx` hook in `UserProfile.tsx`
- Removed direct media state management from the main component
- Ensured MediaSection component receives properly typed props
- Maintained all functionality while simplifying the main component

### Code Stability Improvements (Latest)

- Fixed duplicate variable declarations (`setCropState`, `imageError`, `imageLoading`, etc.)
- Resolved conflicts between imported functions and local declarations (`addMedia`, `removeMedia`)
- Added proper type casting to handle type compatibility for data structures (`SpotlightItem`, `ShopItem`)
- Fixed build environment issues with the `.next` directory
- Created a stable checkpoint (`UserProfile.stable_checkpoint.tsx`)
- **Temporarily reverted to stable checkpoint** while fixing integration issues with new components

### Component Structure Refactoring (Complete)

- Created separate view-only component (`ProfileView.tsx`) that matches the original styling exactly
- Created editing component (`ProfileEditor.tsx`) with proper styling and preview mode
- Created container component (`UserProfileContainer.tsx`) to manage state and mode switching
- Created type definition files for spotlight and shop items
- Created example data files to decouple from the main component
- Added sticky footer for editing mode and preview mode
- Implemented proper animations for fade-in effects
- Maintained identical styling and layout as the original component
- Restored full functionality including profile editing, media management, and section visibility controls

## Planned Refactorings

### State Management Enhancements

- Create useSpotlightState hook for better organization
- Create useShopState hook for better organization
- Enhance useProfileState with better validation
- Add proper loading states for asynchronous operations

### Form Component Extraction

- Extract BasicInfoForm into a separate component
- Extract SocialLinksForm into a dedicated component
- Create reusable FormSection wrapper
- Implement more robust validation patterns

### Performance Optimization

- Memoize expensive components with React.memo
- Optimize state updates with useReducer where appropriate
- Implement proper React.Suspense for async operations
- Add proper skeletons for loading states

### Profile View Component

- Extract the view-only mode into a separate component
- Separate display logic from editing functionality
- Maintain consistent styling between view and edit modes

### Edit Form Modularization

- Start with extracting the basic information section (name, title, bio)
- Create reusable form components for each section
- Implement proper validation and error handling

### Spotlight/Projects Section Extraction

- Create a dedicated hook for managing spotlight/projects state
- Move related handlers to the hook
- Simplify the UI component to focus on rendering

### Shop Section Extraction

- Create a dedicated hook for managing shop items state
- Move related handlers to the hook
- Simplify the UI component to focus on rendering

## Benefits Achieved

- Improved code maintainability and readability
- Better separation of concerns
- Reduced component complexity
- Enhanced type safety
- More focused components with clearer responsibilities
- Better testability for isolated pieces 
- More stable development environment with fewer runtime errors
