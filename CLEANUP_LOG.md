### Task 6: Replace Root Page with Redirect
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-6-remove-root-page`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/page.tsx` (replaced component with redirect to `/integrated`)
- **Notes:**
  - The root page was using `UserProfileContainer`, but we're exclusively using `IntegratedProfile`
  - Rather than removing the file entirely, replaced it with a redirect for better UX
  - Ensures users accessing the root URL (`/`) are directed to our working implementation
- **Verification:**
  - Verified the redirect works properly
  - Tested that the app still functions correctly
  - Confirmed there are no regressions in functionality

### Task 7: Investigate Type System for Refactoring
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-7-refactor-types`
- **Notes:**
  - Analyzed the type system and dependencies
  - Found a mix of direct type imports and re-exports, with complex interdependencies
  - Documented findings for future dedicated refactoring task
- **Learning:**
  - The project's type system requires a more focused effort to standardize
  - Type changes can have subtle cascading effects across the codebase
  - Marked this as a future dedicated task

### Task 8: Remove Unused Reset Profile Button
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-8-remove-unused-reset-button`
- **Files Removed:**
  - `app/resetProfileButton.tsx`
  - `app/resetProfileButton.checkpoint_media.tsx`
- **Notes:**
  - Found these components weren't imported or used anywhere in the codebase
  - The reset functionality is already available through the `/reset` route
- **Verification:**
  - Verified application still functions correctly after removal
  - Tested that the app loads and the main features work

### Task 9: Update Cleanup Log
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-9-update-log`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `CLEANUP_LOG.md` (updated with detailed information about tasks 7 & 8)
- **Notes:**
  - Added comprehensive details about type system investigation
  - Added information about removing unused reset profile button
  - Expanded documentation on lessons learned

### Task 10: Remove Unused i18n Directory
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-10-remove-unused-i18n`
- **Files Removed:**
  - `app/i18n/index.ts`
  - `app/i18n/locales/en.json`
  - `app/i18n/locales/es.json`
- **Notes:**
  - Removed internationalization support that wasn't being used in the working app
  - Confirmed no components were importing or using the i18n functionality
  - Simplified the codebase by removing unused features
- **Verification:**
  - Verified application still functions correctly after removal
  - Tested that the app loads and the main features work

### Task 11: Update Cleanup Log Again
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-11-update-log`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `CLEANUP_LOG.md` (updated with details about tasks 9 & 10)
- **Notes:**
  - Ensured all tasks are thoroughly documented
  - Maintained comprehensive documentation of the cleanup process

### Task 12: Remove Remaining Test Files
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-12-remove-remaining-test-files`
- **Files Removed:**
  - `app/test-auth/simple-auth.tsx`
  - Empty test directories (`app/test`, `app/test-auth`, `app/test-navbar`, `app/auth-test`)
- **Notes:**
  - Removed the last remaining test file that wasn't being used
  - Cleaned up empty directories that were left after removing the test route pages
- **Verification:**
  - Verified application still functions correctly after removal
  - Tested that the app loads and the main features work

### Task 13: Attempted to Remove Checkpoint Files (Failed)
- **Branch:** `cleanup-task-13-remove-checkpoint-file` (reverted)
- **Attempted Changes:**
  - Tried to remove `app/lib/checkpoints/example-content.checkpoint.ts`
  - Tried to remove the checkpoints directory
- **Issues:**
  - Removing the checkpoint file caused the app to enter an infinite loading state
  - No direct imports of this file were found via grep search, suggesting dynamic imports or indirect usage
- **Learning:**
  - Confirmed that some checkpoint files are actually used by the application even without explicit imports
  - Highlights the complex interdependencies in the codebase
  - Reinforces our earlier finding that checkpoint files need careful assessment
- **Resolution:**
  - Reverted changes to restore functionality
  - Left the checkpoint file and directory in place

### Task 14: Standardize ProfileData Type - Image Field
- **Branch:** `refactor/type-standardization-image-field`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/types/index.ts` (made `image` field optional by adding `?`)
- **Rationale:**
  - Found inconsistency between type definitions: 
    - In `app/types/index.ts` the field was required (`image: string`)
    - In `app/types/profile.ts` the field was optional (`image?: string`)
  - Code already handles missing image values with fallbacks like `profile.image || '/images/placeholder-profile.jpg'`
  - Making the field optional aligns with actual usage in the codebase
  - This is the safer approach as it's more permissive
- **Verification:**
  - Ran TypeScript compiler to check for errors (found only pre-existing errors unrelated to our change)
  - Tested the application loads correctly at `/integrated`
  - Verified profile images display correctly
  - Confirmed authentication and editing still work properly
  - Tested that saving profile data functions as expected

### Task 15: Standardize SocialLink Type
- **Branch:** `refactor/standardize-sociallink-type`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/types/profile.ts` (replaced `SocialLinkType` with imported `SocialLink` from '@/types')
  - `app/components/profile/editor/sections/PersonalInfoEditor.tsx` (updated import and references)
- **Rationale:**
  - Found inconsistency between type naming:
    - `SocialLink` in `app/types/index.ts`
    - `SocialLinkType` in `app/types/profile.ts`
    - Both had identical structures with same fields: `platform` and `url`
  - Standardized on `SocialLink` from `@/types/index.ts` since that's what's used in the working implementation
  - This improves type consistency across the codebase and reduces confusion
- **Verification:**
  - Ran TypeScript compiler to check for errors
  - Started the application to verify it works correctly
  - Tested profile editing functionality to ensure social links still work

### Task 16: Standardize ProfileData - sectionVisibility Field
- **Branch:** `refactor/standardize-sectionvisibility-field`
- **Files Modified:**
  - `app/types/profile.ts` (added `sectionVisibility` field to match the definition in `app/types/index.ts`)
- **Rationale:**
  - `sectionVisibility` field was missing in `app/types/profile.ts` but present in `app/types/index.ts`
  - This field is essential for controlling which sections are displayed on the profile
  - Adding it ensures type consistency between different ProfileData definitions
  - Helps prevent potential bugs where code expects the field to exist
- **Verification:**
  - Ran TypeScript compiler to check for errors
  - Started the application to verify it loads correctly
  - Tested profile editing functionality to ensure section visibility still works

## Notes for Future Tasks

- **Checkpoint Files:** Multiple attempts to remove checkpoint/backup files have confirmed they are critical to application functionality despite their names suggesting otherwise:
  - `app/lib/checkpoints/example-content.checkpoint.ts` causes infinite loading when removed
  - Some checkpoint files might be loaded dynamically or referenced indirectly
  - A comprehensive dependency analysis would be needed before removing any more checkpoint files
  - Consider renaming these files to better reflect their production status in a future task
- **Types Refactoring:** The application has a complex type system with interdependencies:
  - The working code in `IntegratedProfile` uses centralized types from `@/types`
  - Many other components still import types from `UserProfileContainer` 
  - Attempted to refactor these imports but encountered type compatibility issues
  - Consider standardizing the type system in a dedicated refactoring task
- **Preserving the Reset Functionality:**
  - Currently accessible via `/reset` route
  - The route is linked from the loading state in `IntegratedProfile.tsx`
  - Consider integrating this functionality into the main UI in the future
  - Code is in `app/reset/page.tsx`

## General Approach Followed

1. Create a specific branch for each cleanup task
2. Verify dependencies before removal using grep searches and import analysis
3. Remove unused files
4. Test the application to verify it still functions correctly 
5. Commit changes with detailed descriptions
6. Push to the cleanup repository

## Lessons Learned

1. **Be Surgical in Cleanup:** When removing code, sometimes a more targeted approach is needed rather than removing entire directories
2. **Check for Shared Dependencies:** Components and routes can share hooks, utilities, and other dependencies
3. **Test After Each Change:** Even small changes can have unexpected impacts
4. **Keep Good Backups:** Having branches for each task made it easy to revert when issues were encountered
5. **File Naming Can Be Misleading:** Files with names like "checkpoint" or "backup" might actually be in active use
6. **Type System Complexity:** The project uses a mix of direct type imports and re-exports, making it challenging to refactor without a dedicated effort
7. **Hidden Dependencies:** Some files may have dependencies that aren't apparent through static code analysis or grep searches
8. **Dynamic Imports:** The application may use dynamic imports or lazy loading that makes dependency tracking difficult
