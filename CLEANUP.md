# Cleanup and Refactoring Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step approach for cleaning up and refactoring the codebase to improve maintainability, performance, and code quality. Each step should be tested thoroughly, backed up to a new branch, and pushed to GitHub before proceeding to the next step.

## ⚠️ CRITICAL GUIDELINES

1. **The `/integrated` route MUST be preserved** - This is the only working implementation
2. Any component referenced by the `/integrated` route must not be removed or modified without careful testing
3. Make incremental changes - one small change at a time
4. Test thoroughly after each change
5. Commit and push to GitHub after each successful change
6. Create a new branch for major cleanup phases
7. Keep debug logs during initial cleanup, remove them later

## Testing Requirements After EVERY Change

1. **Verify the application loads correctly** at `/integrated`
2. **Test authentication** - connect wallet functionality works
3. **Test edit mode** - can toggle between view and edit modes
4. **Test each section editor** - all modals open and save correctly:
   - Personal Info editor
   - Spotlight editor
   - Media editor
   - Shop editor
   - Sticker editor
5. **Test data persistence** - refresh the page and verify data is preserved
6. **Test responsive behavior** - verify layout on mobile and desktop sizes

## Backup Strategy

- Create a new branch for each cleanup task: `cleanup-task-1-remove-XYZ`, etc.
- Create checkpoints with `git commit` after each significant change
- Push to GitHub after each successful test with `git push`
- Never proceed to the next task without verifying current changes work correctly
- If something breaks, revert to the last working commit

## Phase 1: Identify and Remove Unused Files

1. **Identify Unused Routes and Pages**
   - **PRESERVE** the `/integrated` route and all its dependencies
   - Analyze other routes and pages
   - List files that are not being used
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Remove unused route files one at a time, testing after each removal

2. **Identify Unused Components**
   - Check for multiple implementations of similar components
   - Determine which versions are currently in use by the `/integrated` route
   - List components that are not being referenced
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Remove unused component files one at a time, testing after each removal

3. **Identify Unused Utilities and Helpers**
   - Check for duplicate utility functions
   - List utilities that are not being referenced
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Remove unused utility files

## Phase 2: Refactor and Consolidate Duplicate Code

1. **Consolidate Component Logic**
   - Focus on components with multiple implementations
   - Ensure the current implementation in use is properly identified
   - Extract shared logic into utility functions
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Update imports to point to the correct components

2. **Refactor Data Management**
   - Review localStorage handling across components
   - Ensure the app continues to use the separate storage keys defined in `IntegratedProfile`
   - Consolidate data loading/saving logic
   - Ensure consistent error handling
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Implement improvements one small change at a time

3. **Refactor Authentication Logic**
   - Review authentication implementation
   - Remove any duplicate or outdated auth code
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Implement improvements

## Phase 3: Clean Up and Improve Code Quality

1. **Remove Debug Statements**
   - Identify console.log statements that are no longer needed
   - Keep important logging for production debugging
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Remove unnecessary debug logs

2. **Fix Type Definitions**
   - Address TypeScript linter errors
   - Ensure consistent typing across the codebase
   - Create proper interfaces for all data structures
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Implement type improvements

3. **Improve Code Organization**
   - Restructure files and folders for better organization
   - Group related components together
   - Ensure imports use consistent paths
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Implement organizational improvements

## Phase 4: Performance and UI Improvements

1. **Optimize Component Rendering**
   - Identify and fix unnecessary re-renders
   - Implement React.memo where appropriate
   - Review and optimize useEffect dependencies
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Implement performance improvements

2. **Optimize Storage Operations**
   - Review localStorage operations
   - Throttle or debounce frequent saves
   - Implement smarter change detection
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Implement storage optimizations

3. **UI/UX Refinements**
   - Review and improve responsive behavior
   - Fix any layout or styling issues
   - Ensure consistent styling across components
   - Backup to a new branch
   - Implement UI improvements

## Final Phase: Documentation Update

1. Update README.md with final architecture details
2. Document any known issues or future improvements
3. Update code comments for clarity
4. Remove this CLEANUP.md file from the final version
