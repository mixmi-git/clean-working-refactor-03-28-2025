# Refactoring Implementation Log

## 1. Storage Abstraction with useStorage Hook

### Overview

As our first incremental architecture improvement, we extracted localStorage operations into a custom hook. This creates a clean abstraction layer for storage operations, improves code reusability, and simplifies the component code.

### Implementation Details

- Created `useStorage.ts` in the hooks directory
- Extracted inline storage operations from `IntegratedProfile.tsx`
- Made the hook fully type-safe with TypeScript generics
- Centralized storage keys in one place
- Added proper error handling and SSR safety checks

### Key Benefits

1. **Abstraction Layer**: All storage operations now go through a single interface, making it easier to change the storage mechanism in the future.

2. **Error Handling**: Consistent error handling logic for all storage operations.

3. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript integration with generics for better type checking:
   ```typescript
   const profile = storage.getItem<ProfileData>(storage.KEYS.PROFILE, defaultProfile);
   ```

4. **Code Reduction**: Removed repetitive localStorage access patterns from components.

5. **Improved Testability**: Storage operations can now be mocked more easily for testing.

### Changes to IntegratedProfile Component

- Removed inline storage helper functions
- Imported and used the new `useStorage` hook
- Reduced 77 lines of code
- Fixed a few type incompatibilities

### API Design

The hook provides four main operations:

```typescript
// Get data with a fallback value
const data = storage.getItem<ProfileData>(storage.KEYS.PROFILE, defaultProfile);

// Save data with type safety
storage.setItem(storage.KEYS.PROFILE, updatedProfile);

// Remove a value
storage.removeItem(storage.KEYS.WALLET_ADDRESS);

// Clear all storage
storage.clearAll();
```

All operations are wrapped in try/catch blocks and include safety checks for server-side rendering.

### Progress Toward Architecture Goals

This refactoring is the first step in implementing our component architecture improvement plan:

1. ✅ **Extract Custom Hooks** - Starting with storage operations
2. ⬜ **Introduce Context Providers**
3. ⬜ **Refactor Large Components**
4. ⬜ **Update Tests and Documentation**

### Next Steps

With the storage abstraction in place, our next refactoring candidates could be:

1. Create a `useProfile` hook to manage profile state and operations
2. Create a `useAuth` hook for authentication operations
3. Implement context providers to reduce props drilling
4. Refactor large components into smaller, focused ones

Each step continues our incremental approach to architectural improvements, enhancing maintainability without disrupting functionality.
